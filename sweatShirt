/*Rockin' the Dojo Sweatshirt
Ever since you arrived at the Dojo, you wanted one of those cool Coding Dojo sweatshirts - maybe even more than one. Let's say they cost $20 (including tax), but friendly Josh will give a 9% discount if you buy two, or a nice 19% discount if you buy three, or a sweet 35% discount if you buy four or more. He only accepts cash and doesn't have coins, so you have to round up to the nearest dollar. Build a function sweatshirtPricing(num) that, given how many sweatshirts you want, returns the cost.*/

function sweatShirt(num){
    var costs = 0;
    
    if(num ===1){
        costs = 20;
    }
    else if(num ===2){
        costs = Math.ceil(num *20*0.91);
    }
    else if(num === 3){
        costs = Math.ceil(num*20*0.81);
    }
    else {
        for(var i = 4; i < num+1; i++)
        costs =Math.ceil(i*20*0.65);
    }
    console.log(costs);
    }
